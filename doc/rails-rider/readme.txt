=== Rails Rider ===

Rails Rider helps integrate your WordPress blog's users with your Ruby on Rails users.

== Description ==



== Installation ==

Same as every other WordPress plugin, just pop it into the wp-content/plugins directory and enable it from the admin interface. You will need to set up a secret key, just go to the Plugins -> Rails Rider page and enter a phrase or any series of characters. Make it relatively long (at least 32 characters) and random.

That's it for the WordPress part. (for now)

=== Ruby on Rails ===

The way Rails Rider works is by having Rails send in a callback to wordpress every time a new user is created, updated, or deleted.
